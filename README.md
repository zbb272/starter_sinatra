# Objectives
- Build a Sinatra CRUD app consisting of at least two related models

## Deliverables

<!-- - Build out full CRUD functionality for at least two related models -->
- At least one of the models should have a way to create its associated model at the same time (e.g., provide a way for a person to create an Author and their books at the same time)
